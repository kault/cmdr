Built on a Ruby backend with a touch-oriented HTML5 interface, it is currently deployed in over 40 classrooms on our campus; all of which are maintained by our Instructional Media Services student programming group.\r\n\r\ncmdr is split into three parts: \r\n\r\n[cmdr](https://github.com/wesleyan/cmdr): The daemon and touchscreen interface that runs on your typical cmdr controller.\r\n\r\n[cmdr-server](https://github.com/wesleyan/cmdr-server): The central server for control and endoint administration, still a work-in-progress.\r\n\r\n[cmdr-devices](https://github.com/wesleyan/cmdr-devices): Device drivers for hardware that cmdr currently supports.\r\n\r\n###Contact Us\r\nThe best way to reach the team is via our mailing list: cmdr-project@googlegroups.com\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can access the archive and post to the list at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cmdr-project","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
